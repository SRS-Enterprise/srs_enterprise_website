                      Waterproofing involves applying protective treatments to
                      surfaces to prevent water from penetrating and causing
                      damage. It is crucial for maintaining the structural
                      integrity of buildings, preventing mold growth, and
                      ensuring a dry, safe environment.

                <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>
                  Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire
                  liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any
                  provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of
                  the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by
                  You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased
                  anything through the Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
                  shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special,
                  incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever
                  (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits,
                  loss of data or other information, for business interruption,
                  for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any

                  Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this
                  Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised
                  of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
                  fails of its essential purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties
                  or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential
                  damages, which means that some of the above limitations may
                  not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be
                  limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

                  Company's operating offices and in any other places where the
                  parties involved in the processing are located. It means that
                  this information may be transferred to — and maintained on —
                  computers located outside of Your state, province, country or

                  that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this
                  Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take
                  place to an organization or a country unless there are
                  adequate controls in place including the security of Your data
                  and other personal information.
                </p>

                <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
                <p>
                  The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but
                  remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or
                  method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive
                  to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal
                  Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                  If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing

                  and use that information.
